//This problem is a classic variation of the Activity Selection Problem.

//The Activity Selection Problem is a classic optimization problem used to demonstrate the Greedy Algorithm strategy.
//
//The goal is to select the maximum number of activities that can be performed
// by a single person or resource (like a meeting room),
// assuming that each activity has a specific start and end time and that only one activity can happen at a time.

//What is Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)?

//A spanning tree is defined as a tree-like subgraph of a connected,
// undirected graph that includes all the vertices of the graph.
// Or, to say in Layman's words, it is a subset of the edges of the graph
// that forms a tree (acyclic) where every node of the graph is a part of the tree.
//Or, A spanning tree is a tree in which we have N nodes
// (i.e. All the nodes present in the original graph) and N-1 edges
// and all nodes are reachable from each other.

//MINIMUM SPANNING TREE: Among all possible spanning trees of a graph,
// the minimum spanning tree is the one for which the sum of all the edge weights is the minimum.

//The minimum spanning tree has all the properties of a spanning tree
// with an added constraint of having the minimum possible weights
// among all possible spanning trees. Like a spanning tree, there can also be many possible MSTs for a graph.

//Properties of a Spanning Tree:
//The spanning tree holds the below-mentioned principles:
//
//1.The number of vertices (V) in the graph and the spanning tree is the same.
//2.There is a fixed number of edges in the spanning tree which is equal to one less than the total number of vertices ( E = V-1 ).
//3.The spanning tree should not be disconnected, as in there should only be a single source of component, not more than that.
//4.The spanning tree should be acyclic, which means there would not be any cycle in the tree.
//5.The total cost (or weight) of the spanning tree is defined as the sum of the edge weights of all the edges of the spanning tree.
//6.There can be many possible spanning trees for a graph.

//What is Prim's Algorithm?

//It's a greedy algorithm like Kruskal's.
//This algorithm always starts with a single
// node and moves through several adjacent nodes, in order to explore
// all of the connected edges along the way.

//The algorithm starts with an empty spanning tree.
//The idea is to maintain two sets of vertices.
// The first set contains the vertices already included in the MST,
// and the other set contains the vertices not yet included.
//At every step, it considers all the edges that connect the two sets
// and picks the minimum weight edge from these edges.
// After picking the edge, it moves the other endpoint of the edge to the set containing MST.
